### Overview
My vision for the app is to have a tool for coaches to keep track of everything they have in a simple, but powerful way. I am an assistant baseball coach at a local college and I know first hand how difficult it can be to keep track of everything that we have. Right now My head coach uses a dreadfully unorganized microsoft excel spreadsheet that is only as organized as he makes it. Using my app, my coach will be able to save time and headaches. Each item will be able to be added to the inventory, and once it is in the system you are able to move it around to different places. No two players can have the same item. You can keep track of each item and where it has been. The layout will be intuitive so that it will minimize the pages you have to go to, but also keeps everything simple so that it maximizes UX. 
I will also add a few other features to make coaching a little easier. We often have to plan our trips across the country. To do this we have another spreadsheet that is just as unorganized. I will integrate this functionality into my app as well. Something else that the head coach has to keep track of is different tasks the players have to complete such as getting payment for our spring break trip, or communicating with professors about an upcoming game that they will have to miss class for. Having everything in one place, where everything is simple and it basically organizes itself will make everything way easier for our coaching staff and maybe… just maybe we won't lose track of so many things.
